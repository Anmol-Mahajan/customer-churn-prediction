The swift growth of the technological industry has transformed the course of doing business. The companies are creating products around the customer needs and focusing on maintaining a long term relationship with their services. The subscription based model is a result of the ongoing technical advancements in the field of commercial use of artificial intelligence. The consumer has now ability to choose from a variety of products and services which makes the organisations uncertain about their long term survival in the consumer space. The study proposes a machine learning based churn prediction model for a subscription based internet services provider in the business- to-customer(B2C) setting focusing on profit maximisation. The dataset used for the analysis is contributed by IBM and is imbalanced with most non-churners. The dataset is resampled using sampling methods like SMOTE and BorderLine resampling method. The random forest classifier showed promising results with accuracy of nearly 96% stating that algorithm can be applied in the required setting to the dataset. The models are evaluated against each other based on their feature importance, confusion matrix, F1-score, AUC score, Precision-Recall and Accuracy Score.
